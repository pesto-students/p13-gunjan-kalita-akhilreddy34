Describe the concept of indexing in a database. How does indexing improve query performance?

indexing is used for search optimization when you apply indexing on a particular field  it will create a separate table for all the rows in that field in sorting order
so when ever you search using that field we already have data in sorted fashion so it will do binary search and give the result in very efficient and optimized way.
