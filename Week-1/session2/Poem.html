      I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br />

      Are you - Nobody - Too? <br />

      Then there's a pair of us! <br />

      Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!
    </p>
    <p>
      How dreary - to be - Somebody! <br />

      How public - like a <em>Frog</em> - <br />

      To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!
