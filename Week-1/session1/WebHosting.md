# WEB HOSTING

Web hosting simply means deploying and making our website accessible to the world. There are different types of web hosting available and below are the details of that.

## TYPES

### SHARED HOSTING 
- Shared hosting means  we have one server and many applications and  we deploy all our applications  on that one server is called shared hosting.
- All the applications use the available resources and cpu of the machine.
- It is cost effective as we are not using different servers for hosting in different machines.
- These kind of hosting is good for initial stages of the website when the traffic is  very low.

### VPS HOSTING
- Vps hosting  means we are dividing the single physical server into multiple virtual machines and each virtual machine will have its allocated resources like cpu ram.
- These virtual machines also be isolated and does not pollute other virtual machine
- The division of physical server into multiple virtual machines is done by applications like Hypervisor.
- Like in above example mentioned in shared hosting like if you have multiple applications and want to deploy in same machine by using vps each application will be provided dedicated resources and isolation.
- The performance will be high for VPS hosting servers than the shared hosting  servers.

### MANAGED HOSTING
- Managed hosting means like you just need to worrry about the developmennt and depoyment of application and dont need to care about the infrastructure and installations and scaling all will be handled by cloud providers.
- Example of that is aws elastic bean stalk.

### CLOUD HOSTING
- It means you host or deploy your website or application in the machine rented by the cloud provider.
- It simply means rent a machine  provided by cloud providers and manage the infrastructure and deploy your application.
- Example- aws ec2
-  This kind of hosting is used when you are not sure abou the traffic of your website and you are sure that there will be fluctuations in the traffic.

### DEDICATED HOSTING
- This means you own a server and you are responsible for managing maintaining  and deploying installing your applications.
- These kind of hosting is used in most secure and high traffic web sites or applications.
- In this kind of hosting you have highest control on the server (machines).
