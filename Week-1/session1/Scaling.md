### SCALING
Scaling means expanding our servers due to high traffic so that website does not  go into the down time for the requests coming in.

### WHY SCALING IS IMPORTANT 
- As internet is growing very fast the expectation  of the user regarding website is also growing very fast so our websibe should be very quick enough in response time without having the down time even at high traffic.
- so to achieve the high availability and no down time for our website we need to scale our  servers whenever necessary.
- We need to scale our severs when our servers reach some particular threshold.
There are two types of SCALING 
### VERTICAL SCALING
- As said  earlier if our servers reaches particular threshold we can increase the resources of our server like increasing the ram from 8gb to 20 gb and harddisk from 1tb to 2tb.
- SO incresing the capacity of our machine instead of creating a new sercer is called vertical scaling.
- But there is a limitation in vertical scaling we can only increase the resources  of our machine to some extent after that we cant do that so then  we can chosse seconf type of hosting called Horizontal scaling.

### HORIZONATAL SCALIMG
- In horizontal scaling we will spin a new server when our server reaches a specific threshold.
- So we  dont have any limitations like vertical scaling in horizonatl scaling.
- We need to use a cloud based servers to spin a new server whenever needed because it will automatically create a server when traffic is high and again whwn traffic is low it will remove the extra server and we only will pay for the resources which we have used so it is really efficient to use cloud based horizontal scaling.
